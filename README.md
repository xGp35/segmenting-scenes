# Segmenting Scenes in Stories

A scene is a contained narrative unit that takes place within a larger narrative. Scenes are the building blocks of stories. Most stories are made up of a series of scenes that vary in setting and advance the plot. In drama, scene refers to a division within an act of a play, indicated by a change of locale, abrupt shift in time, or the entrance or exit of a major character. So, by keeping track of shifts in location, time and presence or absence of different characters we try to identify segmentation boundaries in stories.
